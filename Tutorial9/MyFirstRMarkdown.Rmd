# My First R Markdown  

## Introduction  

**Markdown** is a very basic and easy-to-use syntax for styling written documents.
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
You can even [link to FCSIT](https://fsktm.um.edu.my/)! 

**Here is a code chunk and it prints the code and result.** 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

*Here is a code chunk but it only print the result.*
```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Here is a code chunk but it doesn't print anything!!!
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Inline text computation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
time <-format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

### The current time is `r time`.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotrix)
lecturer_df <- data.frame(academicStatus = c("Professor","Associate Professor","Senior Lecturer","Lecturer",                                           "Tutor"),number = c(10,35,18,8,3))

fan.plot(lecturer_df$number,max.span=pi,labels=paste(lecturer_df$academicStatus,lecturer_df$number,sep="-"),main="Academician by Status (fan.plot)",ticks=35)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
