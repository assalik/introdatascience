# a) Interprating the confusion matrix
![](Q1.png)


In this example, the model correctly predicted for *Tested Positive* is *120 times* and
*incorrectly predicted* it *15 times*. The model correctly predicted for *Tested Negative*
is 50 times and *incorrectly predicted* it *10 times*.

### The following can be computed from this confusion matrix:
  * The model made __170__ correct predictions __(120 + 50)__.
  * The model made __25__ incorrect predictions __(15 + 10)__.
  * There are __195__ total scored cases __(120 + 15 + 10 + 50)__.
  * The error rate is __25/195__ = __0.1282__.
  * The overall accuracy rate is __170/195__ = __0.8718__.
 
# b) EDA and Codebook
## EDA

_Description_

- An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

_Format_

- A data frame with _71 observations_ on the following _2 variables_.

    *weight* = a numeric variable giving the chick weight.

    *feed* = a factor giving the feed type.
    
_Details_
- Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. Their weights in grams after six weeks are given along with feed types.

*Dataset of Chicken Weight by Feed Type(first 6 data)*
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(chickwts)
head(chickwts)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts, col = "yellow",
    varwidth = TRUE, notch = FALSE, main = "Chicken Weights by Feed Type", ylab = "Weight at six weeks (gm)")
```

## Codebook
-Categorical Variables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
table(chickwts$feed)
```
- The summary for each feed type.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
by(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed, summary)
```
- The standard deviation of the weights grouped by feed type.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
by(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed, mean)
```

# c) Demonstration  of dplyr for data manipulation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Palestine <- read.csv("C://Users//USER//Downloads//Palestine Body Count.csv")
Palestine <- head(Palestine,10)
print(Palestine)
```
## i) Changing the existing column name.
```{r}
Palestine1 <- dplyr :: rename(Palestine, "Palestinians_Killed" = Palestinians.Killed, "Israelis_Killed" = Israelis.Killed)
```
  + Changed the column name from _Palestinians.Killed_ to _Palestinians_Killed_
  + Changed the column name from _Israelis.Killed_ to _Israelis_Killed_
  + This changes used _(dplyr::rename(dataframe,existing.name = new.name))_

## ii) Pick rows based on their values.
```{r}
dplyr::filter(Palestine1, as.numeric(Palestinians_Killed) > 100)
```
  + Picked the row with Palestinians_Killed which are more than 100 by using _(dplyr::filter(dataframe, condition))_

## iii) Add new columns to a data frame.
```{r}
Palestine2 <- dplyr::mutate(Palestine1, Palestinian_Injured = as.numeric(Palestinians_Killed)*2)
```
  + Added a new columns named "Palestinian_Injured" and the data are (Palestinians_Killed*2)
  + by using _(dplyr::mutate(dataframe, new.variable = choosed.variable*2))_

## iv) Combine data across two or more data frames
```{r, echo=FALSE}
PalestineCombine <- read.csv("C://Users//USER//Downloads//CombineDataFrame.csv")
PalestineCombine <- head(PalestineCombine,10)
```
```{r}
dplyr::bind_cols(Palestine2, PalestineCombine)
```
  + Combined 2 set of dataframe (Palestine2) & (PalestineCombine) into one dataframe by using _(dplyr::bind_cols(dataframe1, dataframe2))_
